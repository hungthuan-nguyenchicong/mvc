It looks like you're trying to set up a basic router in JavaScript, but there are a few issues in your provided code snippets that are preventing it from working as intended.

Let's break down the problems and then I'll provide a corrected version.

Issues in Your Code
Multiple Router Instances in main.js:

You have //const router = new Router(); commented out, but then immediately after, new Router(); is present. This creates a Router instance without any routes.
In router.js, you also have new Router(routes); at the very end. This creates another Router instance. You generally only want one router instance managing your application's routes.
routes Variable Scope:

The routes array is defined within router.js but outside the Router class. While it's accessible within that file, the Router instance created in main.js won't automatically receive these routes unless you explicitly pass them.
Calling router() Method:

You're creating Router instances, but you're not actually calling the router() method on any of them, which is where you intend to log the routes.
Corrected Code
Here's how you can refactor your code to get your router working:

js/router.js
JavaScript

export class Router {
    constructor(routes) {
        // Ensure routes are provided, otherwise initialize as an empty array
        this.routes = routes || [];
    }

    // A simple method to log the routes (or handle routing logic in a real app)
    navigate() {
        this.logRoutes();
    }

    logRoutes() {
        console.log("Current Routes:", this.routes);
    }

    // You can add more methods here for actual routing, like:
    // async resolve() { ... }
    // push(path) { ... }
}

// Define your routes here or import them from another file if they get large
const appRoutes = [
    { path: '/', view: 'index' }, // Changed '/' view to 'index' for clarity
    { path: '/home', view: 'home' },
    { path: '/about', view: 'about' }, // Added another example route
];

// Export the routes so they can be imported by main.js
export { appRoutes };
js/main.js
JavaScript

import { Router, appRoutes } from './router.js';

// Create a single instance of the Router and pass the routes to it
const router = new Router(appRoutes);

// Now, call the navigate method to see the routes logged
router.navigate();

// In a real application, you'd likely call router.navigate()
// when the DOM is ready or based on user interactions (e.g., popstate event)
// window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
//     router.navigate();
// });
// window.addEventListener('popstate', () => {
//     router.navigate();
// });
Explanation of Changes
Consolidated Router Definition: The appRoutes array is now defined in router.js and exported alongside the Router class.
Single Router Instance: In main.js, we now create only one instance of Router, explicitly passing the appRoutes to its constructor.
Meaningful Method Name: I've renamed tt to logRoutes and router to Maps in the Router class. This makes the purpose of these methods clearer.
Calling Maps(): After creating the router instance in main.js, we call router.navigate() to execute the logic within that method (which currently just logs the routes).
With these changes, when you run your code, you should see "Current Routes:" followed by your appRoutes array logged in the console. This sets up a more robust foundation for building out a full-fledged client-side router.

You can test the POST endpoint using the curl command in your WSL terminal.

Testing POST with curl ðŸ’»
Here's how to send a POST request with JSON data to your /api/posts endpoint:

Bash

curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "My New Post", "content": "This is the content of my new post."}' \
     http://localhost:3000/api/posts
Breakdown of the curl Command:
curl: The command-line tool for making HTTP requests.

-X POST: Specifies that this is an HTTP POST request.

-H "Content-Type: application/json": Sets the Content-Type header to application/json. This tells your Bun server that the body of the request is in JSON format, allowing req.json() to parse it correctly.

-d '{"title": "My New Post", "content": "This is the content of my new post."}': Specifies the data to be sent in the request body.

-d (or --data): Used to send data in a POST request.

'...': The entire JSON payload is enclosed in single quotes to ensure it's treated as a single argument by the shell, even if it contains spaces or special characters.

{"title": "My New Post", "content": "This is the content of my new post."}: This is the actual JSON payload you're sending.

http://localhost:3000/api/posts: The URL of your API endpoint. Make sure your Bun server is running on port 3000 before executing this command.

Expected Output
If your Bun server is running and the POST endpoint is set up correctly, you should see a JSON response similar to this in your terminal:

JSON

{"id":"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef","title":"My New Post","content":"This is the content of my new post."}
(The id will be a unique UUID generated by crypto.randomUUID().)
